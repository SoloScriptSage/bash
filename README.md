# Bash Learning Scripts

A collection of Bash scripts created while learning shell scripting fundamentals and best practices.

## About

This repository contains various Bash scripts that demonstrate different concepts, techniques, and patterns in shell scripting. Each script serves as a practical example for understanding how Bash works.

## Structure

The scripts are organized to cover various aspects of Bash scripting:

- **Basic concepts**: Variables, loops, conditionals
- **File operations**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files
- **Text processing**: Using tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`
- **System interaction**: Process management, system information
- **Functions and libraries**: Reusable code patterns
- **Error handling**: Best practices for robust scripts

## Prerequisites

- Bash 4.0 or higher
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Basic understanding of command-line interfaces

## Running Scripts

Make scripts executable before running:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
```

Or run directly with Bash:

```bash
bash script_name.sh
```

## Best Practices

Scripts in this repository aim to follow these conventions:

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Quote variables to prevent word splitting
- Check for errors and handle them appropriately
- Use shellcheck for linting
